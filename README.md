# surfs_up
Using SQLite, VS Code, and Flask to analyze weather data for a surf shop.

# Overview of the anaylsis
The purpose of this analysis is to take the data from 9 different weather stations located in Oahu, Hawaii to determine if the location would
be suitable for a surf and ice cream shop. The temperature of the months of June and December are being analyzed to determine potential issues
throughout the year since surfing requires specific weather.

# Results
## Lowest temperature for June vs December
It is worth pointing out the difference between the lowest recorded temperature in June vs December. June's lowest temperature was 64 degrees 
which is still a temperature, in my opinion, that many people would still surf in. Especially if they are wearing a wet suit. But, the lowest
temperature in december was 56 degrees which I would think is too cold for many people to surf or want ice cream for that matter. I believe
this would be especially true for tourists visiting.

## Average temperature for June vs December
The average temperature for June also looks much more promising for the surf and ice cream shop. The average temperature is approximately 4 degrees higher
for June than December with 74.9 degrees and 71.0 degrees respectively. However, it is worth noting that the lowest temperature in December doesn't 
seem like good surfing or ice cream weather, but the average temperature shows that December is still going to be a viable season for some sales. It
will not be like Minnesota where we would have to shut down in the winter.

## Standard Deviation of June and December  
The standard deviation for June and December are both over the +/- 2 standard deviation we look for in statistics. Since June has an SD of 3.26 and
December has an SD of 3.75, they are both having a pretty large range of values. It is also worth noting that December has a higher SD than June by 
approximately 0.5 which helps explain the differences in the minimum temperatures between the two months.

# Summary
In summary, based on the temperature for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii, I would definitely say that a surf and ice cream shop would be a
viable business model for the location. There aren't many days throughout the year where customers wouldn't want to utilize the business. However,
there is more weather data that could be analyzed. The first would be wind speed since weather with little to no wind wouldn't allow for waves to surf
with, and higher speeds would create waves that are too large for the average customer to surf. Lastly, I would also look at the cloudiness of area.
Since many people don't want ice cream or likely to want to surf on cloudy days, this data could affect the business.
